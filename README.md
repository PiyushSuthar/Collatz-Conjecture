# Collatz-Conjecture
The visual representation of The Simplest Math Problem No One Can Solve. (3N+1 Problem)

## AKA The `3N+1` Problem.

The infamous Collatz conjecture says that if you start with any positive integer, you’ll always end up in this loop. 

The result, at some point, will end up in a loop of `4,2,1`.

### How does this work?

I'll suggest you watch [The Simplest Math Problem No One Can Solve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg) by Veritasium.
Or read [The Simple Math Problem We Still Can’t Solve](https://www.quantamagazine.org/why-mathematicians-still-cant-solve-the-collatz-conjecture-20200922/)

Basically what it does is that when we give some number as an input, it checks if it's odd or even. If the number is odd, it'll multiply it by 3 and add 1. And if the number is even it'll divide it by 2.

It will keep on doing it and after some time, it'll reach at a point where it'll be in a loop of `4 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 2 ->...`
